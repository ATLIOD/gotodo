## GO TO-DO
gotodo is a todo application written in GO\
I wanted to learn GO and wanted to start with something that I know I will use\
I use to write my tasks to get done for the day in a notebook that I carry around in my backpack, but i thought it would be nice to be able to track them digitally instead.\
Currently gotodo is a cli applicaiton but I will be moving it over into an API and then a REST api as the project continues
